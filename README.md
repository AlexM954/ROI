# Region of Interest
The region of interest (ROI) algorithm aims to extract features in complex data, such as mass spectrometry (MS) data. This repo provides implementations for the algorithm proposed in the paper:
> Tautenhahn, R., BÃ¶ttcher, C. & Neumann, S. Highly sensitive feature detection for high resolution LC/MS. BMC Bioinformatics 9, 504 (2008). https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-9-504

# Aims
1. Provide multiple implementations of the ROI algorithm written in various languages.
2. Optimize the performance of the implementations to be as fast a possible in the given language.
3. Provide improvements to the algorithm, if possible.

# Installation
### Python
In order to install the Python implementation of the ROI algorithm. Pip install it using the following command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/AlexM954/ROI.git#egg=roi&subdirectory=python
```
